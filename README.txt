The notebooks directory contains a Jupyter notebook for the baseline calculations and also plotting of the loss graphs with the computed losses from the models.

We only kept the most relevant code files for our project in this repository. 

For in-context-learning, we made additions or modifications to the following files:
- samplers.py
- tasks.py
- train.py
and we also made our own yaml configuration file.
